# VaultSpark

VaultSpark is a unified, AI-enhanced DeFi vault system built on the BlockDAG EVM-compatible testnet. It enables seamless currency exchange, smart lending and borrowing, NFT-based on-chain rewards, and real-time analytics — all accessible through a secure, wallet-native interface using MetaMask.

## Problem Statement

Decentralized finance is fragmented, difficult to use, and lacks integrated insights or reward structures. Users must juggle multiple platforms for swapping, lending, and engagement. VaultSpark solves this by offering all core DeFi features in one secure, open, and scalable ecosystem.

## Project Objective

- Secure lending and borrowing via smart contracts  
- Instant token swaps using programmable liquidity logic  
- NFT-based rewards linked to user engagement  
- Real-time analytics using Supabase  
- Seamless MetaMask wallet connectivity via wagmi and ethers.js  
- Fully open-source and deployed on the BlockDAG testnet
